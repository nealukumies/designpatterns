# Design Patterns
This is a repository for the assignments in course ["Design Patterns"](https://github.com/vesavvo/design_patterns/tree/master) at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences.
Java is used as the programming language for the assignments. Below is a brief overview of the assignments and their goals that
are provided by the teacher. 
## Assignment 1: Factory Method
The goal is to design an application that generates a random map for a role-playing game using the Factory Method design pattern.
## Assignment 2: Abstract Factory
The goal is to implement a simple ASCII art-based user interface element creation factory using the Abstract Factory design pattern in Java.
## Assignment 3: Composite
The goal is to design an application that represents and keeps track of an organizational structure using the Composite design pattern.
## Assignment 4: Observer
The goal is to design and implement a system in Java that consists of a weather stations and weather observers.
## Assignment 5: Singleton
Your goal is to design and implement a Logger system in Java using the Singleton design pattern.
## Assignment 6: Decorator
In this assignment, you start by implementing a Printer class in Java that provides basic functionality to print a message to the console. Then, the objective is to extend this functionality using the Decorator design pattern.
## Assignment 7: State
Your goal is to design and implement a console-based Java application that simulates the development of a game character through different levels of proficiency.
## Ass√≠gnment 8: Template method
Your goal is to apply a simple game framework to make a game of your choice.
## Assignment 9: Strategy
Your goal is to implement at least three sorting algorithms using the Strategy pattern, and empirically compare their performance with two different data sets.
## Assignment 10: Chain of Responsibility
The goal is to create a program that handles different forms of customer feedback messages. 
## Assignment 11: Memento
The goal is to add redo functionality and history window to provided GUI that already uses undo functionality with Memento pattern.
## Assignment 12: Proxy
The goal is to create a protection proxy that controls access to documents in the document library.
## Assignment 13: Visitor
Your goal is to design and implement a simple file system model in Java using the Visitor design pattern.
## Assignment 14: Builder
Your goal is to develop a system to construct various types of computer configurations using the Builder design pattern.
## Assignment 15: Adapter
Your goal is to develop a Java adapter that interfaces the java.util.Calendar class with a new interface, NewDateInterface, which defines methods for setting and getting the day, month, and year. Additionally, include a method advanceDays() in the interface that advances the date by a given number of days.
## Assignment 16: Bridge
Your goal is to select a bridge pattern implementation published on the web and extend it with additional functionality. Write pdf documentation about the original implementation and your extension. [Example](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/bridge/java/example) is from Refactoring Guru.
## Assignment 17: Flyweight
Your goal is to extend the RPG map generator from Assignment 1 (Factory method) by adding graphical rendering of the tiles on the JavaFX canvas.
## Assignment 18: Prototype
Your task is to create a book recommendation system that employs the Prototype design pattern.
## Assignment 19: Mediator
Your goal is to create a real-time chat application that utilizes the Mediator pattern to manage communication between components.
## Assignment 20: Iterator
Your task is to design and implement a Fibonacci sequence generator using the Iterator design pattern in Java.
## Assignment 21: Facade
Your task is to design and implement a facade that simplifies the use of a few subsystems that are needed for API access.
